# The AI Equity Data Challenge (Team MUN)
As artificial intelligence continues to transform industries in Canada, itâ€™s reshaping the future of work in record time. But who stands to gain the most, and who might be left behind?

# ðŸ“Š Data Preparation and Sources

Our analysis draws on three complementary datasets covering **wages, employment, and demographics** in Canada between 2015 and 2024. Below we document how each dataset was obtained, examined, and cleaned.

---

## 1. Job Bank Wages (2015â€“2024)

* **Source:** [Job Bank Canada â€“ Wages by Occupation](https://www.jobbank.gc.ca/trend-analysis/search-wages)
* **Raw form:** Individual yearly CSVs (`jobbank_wages_2015.csv` â€¦ `jobbank_wages_2024.csv`).
* **Initial issues:**

  * Many columns contained only `NaN` values, except for `year` and `median_wage_hourly`.
  * Annual vs. hourly wage inconsistencies.
* **Processing steps:**

  * Unified column names: `year, noc, occupation_title, province, wage_hourly`.
  * Converted **annual wages** into hourly equivalents for consistency.
  * Stacked yearly files into one dataset covering 2015â€“2024.
* **Final output:** `jobbank_wages_2015_2024_hourly_cleaned.csv`
* **Purpose:** Provides **wage trends by occupation and province**, critical for analyzing wage equity under AI-driven labour changes.

## 2. Labour Force Survey (LFS) â€“ Employment by Occupation (2015â€“2024)

* **Source:** [Statistics Canada Table 14-10-0310-01 (formerly CANSIM 282-0155)](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1410031001)
* **Raw form:** Large CSV with monthly employment counts across occupations and provinces.
* **Initial issues:**

  * Included multiple statistics (e.g., standard errors, confidence intervals).
  * Needed harmonization across provinces and years.
* **Processing steps:**

  * Filtered to keep **employment estimates only**.
  * Converted monthly values â†’ **annual averages** (mean of 12 months).
  * Standardized provinces (`ON, QC, NLâ€¦`) and occupations (`noc`).
* **Final output:** `LFS_employment_by_occupation_2015_2024_clean.csv`
* **Purpose:** Captures **labour demand and job distribution by occupation**, aligning with wage data to show supply/demand shifts.

## 3. Labour Force Survey (LFS) â€“ Demographics (2015â€“2024)

* **Source:** [Statistics Canada Table 14-10-0088-01 â€“ Labour force characteristics of immigrants by country of birth](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1410008801)
* **Raw form:** Detailed CSV with employment, participation, and unemployment rates by:

  * Immigrant status,
  * Country of birth,
  * Sex,
  * Age group.
* **Initial issues:**

  * Dataset was wide and complex, requiring restructuring.
  * Some variables irrelevant to our scope.
* **Processing steps:**

  * Extracted only **Employment rate, Participation rate, Unemployment rate**.
  * Standardized columns: `year, province, immigrant_status, country_of_birth, sex, age_group, lf_characteristic, value`.
  * Cleaned missing values (\~1% of entries).
* **Final output:** `LFS_demographics_2015_2024_clean.csv`
* **Purpose:** Provides **demographic insights** (immigrants vs Canadian-born, gender, age cohorts), enabling analysis of **diversity, inclusion, and equity** in employment outcomes.

## Why These Three Datasets?

Together, these datasets give a **multi-dimensional view of the Canadian labour market**:

* **Wages (Job Bank):** How pay differs by occupation and province.
* **Employment by Occupation (LFS):** Which jobs are growing or declining.
* **Demographics (LFS):** Who benefits (or is excluded) from employment opportunities (immigrants, women, younger workers, etc.).

This integrated framework allows us to address questions on:

* Wage equity,
* Regional and occupational skill gaps,
* Demographic impacts of AI adoption.
